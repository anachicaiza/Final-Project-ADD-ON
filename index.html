        Gabriel García Márquez (1927–2014) was a Colombian writer and Nobel
        laureate, best known for pioneering "magical realism". His masterpiece,
        "One Hundred Years of Solitude", cemented him as one of the greatest
        Latin American authors. His works blend reality with fantasy, exploring
        love, power, and destiny, deeply influenced by his Caribbean heritage
        and political views.
